 ## **Protect against threats with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint**

Microsoft Defender for Endpoint uses the following combination of technologies built in:
- Endpoint behavioral sensors: 
  These sensors collect and process behavioral signals from the operating system. The sensors send the data to your private, isolated cloud instance of Microsoft Defender for Endpoint.
- Cloud security analytics:
  Uses big data, machine learning, and unique Microsoft optics across the Windows ecosystem, enterprise cloud products (such as Office 365), and online assets, behavioral signals are translated into insights, detections, and recommended responses to advanced threats.
- Threat intelligence:
