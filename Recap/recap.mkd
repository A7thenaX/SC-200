# Recap Cyber ops concepts

- Inidcators of Compromise (IOCs)
- Alert triage is the process of reviewing, prioritizing, and categorizing security alerts to determine which ones require immediate attention and which can be dismissed or investigated later. Itâ€™s a critical step in incident response and SOC operations.
- An anomaly in cybersecurity refers to any activity or behavior that deviates from the normal or expected pattern
- Proactive means acting in advance to prevent problems or detect threats early.
- Reactive means responding after a problem or threat has already occurred.
